{"name":"C# Encryption DLL","tagline":"DLL class libraries for creating and removing encryption in .Net applications","body":"# Welcome to csharp.encryption\r\nThis is a simple library written in C # to work with encryption in .Net applications.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nThis is a very simple script to use. Create an instance of the class CryptService (making using the correct namespace) and call the method, passing the desired parameter provider (see enum CryptProvider).\r\n\r\n### Encrypt\r\n```\r\nCryptService crip = new CryptService(CryptProvider.DES);\r\ncrip.Key = \"MY_KEY\";\r\nreturn crip.Criptografar(text);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Decrypt\r\n```\r\nCryptService crip = new CryptService(CryptProvider.DES);\r\ncrip.Key = \"MY_KEY\";\r\nreturn crip.Descriptografar(text);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFYI: Namespaces, classes and methods are in Portuguese. Feel free to refactor and translate ;)\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2015, Vinícius Stutz (@vinicius-stutz) founded csharp.encryption.\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with csharp.encryption?
